## Preface
There is a veritable plethora of videos and articles on how to setup a digital Zettlekästen. There are tons of blogs and forums about Niklas Luhmann's practice, his prolific publishing record.

So why add another one? Frankly most of them aren't that helpful. I learn by seeing how something is actually done, especially an analog process. And more importantly, I want it to be true to the process Luhmann discovered. I know there are other methods out there, but this one is specifically for the Zettlekästen, so I want an authentic breakdown.

This post is the culmination of hundreds of hours of research and practice of trying to do an analog zettlekästen "the right way", or as close to it as makes sense.

If you're looking for something like that for yourself, read on. This post is for you if you have a good idea of what it is and why it's awesome, but it's unclear how to get started with your analog. So I'm going to assume you're familiar with Niklas Luhmann, what a Zettlekästen is, and general information about it. I just want to focus on the nuts and bolts of working in an analog system.

If you're not familiar with what it is, checkout these resources:
 * Read [this](https://sociologica.unibo.it/article/view/8350/8270). It's short, to the point, and by someone who studied Luhmann's process in detail.
 * Luhmann wrote an expository [paper](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) on his process. Some good nuggets in there.
 * I'm indebted to Scott Scheper's [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/scottscheper). His videos cleared up a lot of misconceptions for me, and I believe he's working on a book on this subject!

## Equipment setup
Ok, you're ready to start an analog Zettlekästen (slipbox). Here's what you need

 ### 1. Some 4x6 cards

 ### 2. Pens
 I recommend getting a red pen as well.

 ### 3. Permanent note box
 ![](/img/zettlekasten/IMG_3053.jpg)
I acquired this handsome box [here]() but you could easily put one together. You just want something that allows your cards to standup so you can easily rifle through them.

With your notes in a dedicated box, you won't have to worry about them getting mixed up on your desk, lost, etc. 

At this point, you're ready to start to zettle (that's a german noun I turned into a verb for convenience).

 ### 4. Bibliography index box
 ![](/img/zettlekasten/IMG_3038.jpg)
 I made mine from a box that just happened to fit 3x5 cards perfectly. Some tape, sticky notes and voila! 
This is a box that holds references to authors.
Keeping track of who your notes reference is easy when all you have to do is find the card for that author.

Example bibliography card:
![front](/img/zettlekasten/IMG_3040.jpg) 
On the front, I have the author's last name in a box in the upper right hand. I only do this to make it easy to see. Then I have a number and an abbreviation of the title of their work. In this case "The Bhagavad Gita" becomes --> 'TBG' (you'll see why I do this later). I then write a basic bibliographic entry, enough to get the point across.

![back](/img/zettlekasten/IMG_3041.jpg) 
On the back, I write the card index(es) of the permanent notes that were drawing from this author and a brief description of thats there.

NOTE: This is what Ahrens means by "Literature Notes". From what I gathered from his book, he wants you to take notes on the back of the book cards like this, then go back and create permanent notes off of them. I don't do it this way, because I'm moving from different books and media all over the place, and if I don't stop and develop my thought in a permanent note soon, I'm worried I'll forget. So instead, I link my indexed permanent notes to the back of the bibilography card like this. Feel free to try both ways and see what works for you.


 ### 5. Keyword index box
 You might be thinking? What, another box? Do I really need three boxes to take notes? No, you don't __need__ it, but as your permanent notes grow beyond 40-50, you begin to forget. Keeping a keyword/topic index is helpful to file new cards. You see your new card is related to "Communication", so you look up under 'C' in your keyword index under "Communication". If you don't have "Communication", now you can add it in your keyword index.

Example keyword index card:

### 6. Fleeting notes notebook 
One extra piece that Sönke Ahrens recommends is a little notebook to capture what he calls "Fleeting Notes". This is not part of Luhmann's original system or practice. However it's served me well. I carry it around in my backpocket and when I get an idea I write them down. As Ahrens describes in his book, these notes are 'fleeting' (i.e. if you lost it, it wouldn't be a big deal); as you collect ideas in there, sit down and transfer ones you like to your Permanent Notes (the 4x6 cards).

 Here's a picture of what I use for fleeting notes:

So far this covers the "technology" required for an analog Zettlekästen. All that's left is you, your mind, and stuff to read and think about. Now let's talk process.

------------

## Process
High-level process: `Read -> Think ->  Write Zettle -> File Zettle`

But with all these boxes and rules, it's intimidating to start, at least it was for me. I struggle with perfectionism (that darn fixed mindset again!) and I didn't want to build a pile of notes only to realize I did something horribly wrong. Honestly, as great as Ahrens' book is, it didn't give me a lot to go on for implementing (which is kinda misleading for a book entitled "_How to_ Take Smart Notes". A more honest title would be "Why you should take smart notes", but I digress) and I did eventually run into problems. I got about 60 cards in and had done my bibliographies wrong (on the backs of each zettle) and a clunky indexing system based on alternating numbers and letters. It was a painful lesson, one that took time and effort to fix but I'm glad I did it right. That's why I'm writing this for all the other perfectionists out there who want to try this.

So let's break it down further!

(Coming soon! Hopefully tonight I'll get this up here...)
