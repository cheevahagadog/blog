There are special times in life to go all out. 

Last year, I went all out on a 50-mile hike alone, completing it in 19 hours. 

I learned some invaluable lessons like
 - Don't trust Google maps over mountains (I got lost)
 - Always pack an extra almond poppyseed muffin. 
 - Stopping to rest only makes your legs hurt more.

More importantly, I learned that after being alone and exhausted for hours, all the noise in your head quiets down, and you come to know yourself and your limits. Around mile 35-40, you think you're done; you can't even think of 10+ more miles, so you coach yourself to take just one more step.

Nietzsche said, "There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy," but it's hard to tap into that deep wisdom stuck at home all the time. You have to give your body a chance to work it out.

For your effort, extremity rewards you with stark contrast from everyday living. When it's cold, we appreciate a warm fire. When it's hot, nothing sounds better than a cold drink. A healthy dose of extremity activates deep appreciation for simple things.

The next day my feet were thrashed but my mind was still on the mountains. I found pleasure in ordinary things I overlooked before. Music sounded better. I was able to be completely present. 

Find something you can safely go extreme on. Maybe it’s your marriage. Maybe it’s a promise you know you want to make to yourself but haven’t faced up to it.

Whatever it is, getting outside your comfort zone, maybe very far, is where the revitalizing soul-shaping experiences are. You won't always find it in moderation.

And that's why I'm going again, with an extra muffin.
