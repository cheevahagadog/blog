### [The Abolition of Man](https://www.amazon.com/Abolition-Man-Paperback-2001/dp/B004PGZG5E) by C.S. Lewis
_The Abolition of Man_ changed my life. After searching for years for solid ground for truth, I finally have a footing thanks to this small book. Lewis shows that there IS objective value; that there is truth and our humanity is bound up with understanding that body of truth which he refers to as the 'Tao'.
