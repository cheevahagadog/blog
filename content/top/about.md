## What is this blog?
Everything I write here is written with the intent to learn and explore ideas I find interesting. Maybe you will too! Why do it?:
 1. Alzheimers runs in my family and I want to keep my mind alive and growing so it doesn't die before I do.
 2. I'm tired of putting it off.
 3. I want to be a better writer and thinker.
 4. I want to be an influence for good and pay it forward.


## Who am I?
I'm an ordinary person. I'm a husband, father, who has a full-time job but dreams of doing something more with this life. I struggle with the dreaded 'fixed' mindset. I know! I know! That's the one you're not supposed to have!

For my hobbies, I'm a member of [Online Great Books](https://onlinegreatbooks.com/) where I read the great books of western civilization. I also enjoy writing in my ZettleKÃ¤sten system. I also enjoy barbell training, biking, hiking, working on my 1982 Mercedes 240d when I have the spare time.
